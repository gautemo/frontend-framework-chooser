## About what is important for you?

There is no one size fits all, when it comes to the frameworks we can choose between. Do you want the best in terms of developer experience, do you want the fastest one out there for the end users, or do you want the one with the biggest ecosystem?

[npm trends](https://npmtrends.com/@angular/core-vs-preact-vs-react-vs-solid-js-vs-svelte-vs-vue) is a good indicator of what is used the most and therefore have the biggest ecosystem.

[js-framework-benchmark](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html) is a good source for comparing the performance.
